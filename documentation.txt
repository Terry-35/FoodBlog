For this Healthy Eats website, the design was centered around minimalism and responsiveness. I selected a fresh color palette featuring greens and soft neutrals to evoke a natural, healthy vibe. The layout includes a simple navigation bar, a prominent hero slider, and interactive recipe cards that flip on hover to reveal additional details, ensuring an engaging user experience.

JavaScript was used to implement key features such as an auto-rotating image slider, dynamic recipe loading based on URL parameters, and form validation for the contact form. This interactivity enhances usability and ensures users receive immediate feedback on their actions.

During development, one challenge was managing dynamic content within a single page while keeping the code modular. I overcame this by separating the JavaScript functionalities and testing them individually. For deployment, I pushed the code to a Git repository and then linked the repository to Netlify. Netlify automatically built and deployed the project, offering a fast and reliable hosting solution with continuous deployment support.
